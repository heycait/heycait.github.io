		<h3>Why is Pair Programming important to DBC?</h3>

		<p>
			Pair Programming is an important part of the culture and teaching style of DBC. We believe that everyone learns better by teaching and mentoring.
		</p>

		<p>
			Additionally, pair programming and Agile Development are increasingly common in software development in general and pretty standard for Ruby on Rails jobs. It is also likely to be part of the interview process.
		</p>

		Software Engineers pair in order to:
		<ul>
			<li>reduce code errors and/or catch errors early</li>
			<li>share or transfer knowledge</li>
			<li>on-board new developers</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			That said pairing varies between teams. Some pair 99% of the time; some pair only some of the time; others pair only when it makes sense.
		</p>
