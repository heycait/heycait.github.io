    <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
    <p>
      Pairing is tough. I've only had a handful of pairing sessions that I truly enjoyed while the rest were either extremely frustrating, slightly but still frustrating, or for lack of a better term, just whatever. The sessions I enjoyed were with pairs that were on the same level and had similar thinking styles as me (as in how to go about solving the problem). They were also very respectful about accommodating to my personal habits as well as sought out and were receptive to my ideas. Those sessions were my favorite because I not only learned from my pair in a collaborative environment but also struggled with them but still felt very accomplished at the end. The sessions where I had done the challenges prior and were acting as a guide were alright. I didn't really learn anything although I guess you could say acting as a guide solidified the process I had and why I did it (since I ended up asking questions to help my pair determine what needed to be done and the steps to take). The only thing you could say I learned was how other people think through problems however the challenges I acted as a guide were extremely simple and there was only pretty much one easy way to solve them. The rest of the time, I got frustrated with pairing due to various reasons: perceived disrespect, perceived condescension, difference in skill, difference in thinking, etc.
    </p>

    <h3>Frustration with Pairing</h3>
    <p>
      The majority of my pairing sessions have been frustrating for a variety of reasons. As my concrete sequential thinking style suggests, it's difficult for me to work in groups/with other people. I especially struggle with working with people that seem to have a lower skill level. If it appears that my pair's abilities aren't on par with mine, I automatically disregard their suggestions/ideas. The same goes for if their thinking/approach to the problem is different from mine. I know this isn't a good thing to do and it's weird that I even do the latter since I like looking at different solutions and learning from them. However, I've noticed when I solve the problem for the first time, I want to do it <b>my</b> way. After I've solved it according to my thought process, and only after, do I become receptive to other solutions. I probably need to warn my future pairs of this to avoid conflict..
    </p>

    <p>
      The other pairing sessions I didn't like were the ones that were not necessarily frustrating but kind of annoying. These sessions were the ones that either the pair seemed disrespectful or condescending. Disrespectful by not acknowledging my suggestion (even just to disagree) and going straight to their own ideas and condescending by acting as though I did not understand needed an explanation for every detail.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, most of my "unsuccessful" sessions in my opinion were those where I deemed my pair's abilities below mine. It's hard for me not to judge and once I've made the judgment, the session goes downhill from there as I feel my pair brings me down. (This doesn't apply to challenges where I'm acting as a guide though since I'm in an more hands-off role and am not using their solution as my own.) I find these sessions hard to endure because I have to wait and allow my pair to learn and get to my level of understanding by letting them tinker around with the code. And sometimes doing this ends up confusing me. There was one challenge that became unnecessarily difficult because it was hard to discuss possible solutions since all they said was "use this method" and didn't actually know how to do it. That challenge caused me a shit-ton of grief and I only ended up solving it later my reviewing other people's solutions. The only solution I can possibly see for this is doing the challenge solo first and then pairing although this defeats the purpose of pair programming.

    <h3>Giving Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      Writing feedback is a breeze for the sessions with people of similar skill and thinking style. It's writing feedback for those sessions that weren't that is difficult because I have trouble finding something positive to say. Once I classify those sessions as "unsuccessful", it clouds the rest of my ability to judge other aspects of the session and my pair's attributes. This is especially true if I don't give feedback right away. If I forget and write it later, the negativity pervades my memories and I cannot recall anything I found positive. I think I should start making note during my pairing sessions about what I found praiseworthy. Same for what could be improved. I need to turn my focus on those aspects instead of developing an air of superiority over my pair and negative thoughts.
    </p>


    <h3>Receiving Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      A lot of the feedback I received didn't follow the A.S.K. guidelines so I didn't gain as much from those. They weren't exactly actionable or specific although they were kind. There were some that were really good though and I'll be making use of towards my personal development. One piece of feedback I got that was A.S.K.-able said I should "step up to take control". They said they "sometimes felt like I wanted to communicate more directly..." and "should feel confident enough to be as assertive as I like.. speak my mind or offer my point of view". Another commented similarly that I would whisper my thoughts to myself and that I should speak up so others could learn from my thinking process. One person even provided resources for me to check out which was nice. Looking at the feedback I got, it seems I need to learn how to communicate my thought process better. I need to learn how to clearly and effectively turn my thoughts into words and actually share that with my pair instead of just to my invisible friend.
    </p>

    <h3>Overall</h3>
    <p>
      I think feedback in general is necessary for life. Feedback for pairing in particular is a good way to learn about oneself and become a better person and team player. Pairing itself is also important for learning in order to share knowledge. However, I struggle with that when I believe I cannot learn anything from my pair. I need to learn to be more optimistic and accepting to see learning opportunities at those times. I also need to work on being kind, considerate, and helpful to my pair.
