        <h3>1. Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</h3>
          <p>Recently I've been kind of annoyed with a relation of mine. For the sake of simplicity, let's call this person "Joe". The things that Joe's been doing has bothered the crap out of me and it's hard for me to even want to hang out with him. Nothing really "happens," it's more of a how it feels to hang out with him kind of thing. </p>
        <h3>2. What was the source of the conflict?</h3>
          <p>Most recent example was just today when we were driving in the car, there were multiple things that bothered me. Issue 1 — Joe always comments on other people's driving and his annoyance with them. Issue 2 — He also drives really fast to show off the car that he's so proud of (which means you get jerked in your seat from fast acceleration and breaking — think race car driving). Issue 3 — Joe always talks about his car and his job working with cars. Issue 4 — When you talk to Joe about whatever's on your mind, it doesn't seem like he's interested and would rather talk about cars. </p>
        <h3>3. What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</h3>
          <p>Super annoyed. Unhappy. It's just that he always has to talk about cars or his job working with cars and when you talk about something else he listens but doesn't seem to really listen. It makes me feel like what I'm talking about is not important or interesting enough to bother feigning interest. I see this and it makes me stop talking but Joe says, "I'm listening." But it's such a nonchalant "go on" that I don't want to go on with what I'm saying anymore. I guess with this I'm annoyed that Joe thinks he's so interesting talking about his car all the time that there couldn't possibly be anything else to talk about WORTH talking about.</p>
        <h3>4. What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</h3>
          <p>Well I haven't done anything in regards to issues number 1 (road rage) or 4 (seeming uninterested) but I did mention how I felt like he always talks about work and cars and nothing else. This was food for thought for him. Some time during the drive, I also mentioned how driving his car is hard for me (since I'm used to my fat-kid-on-the-block Toyota Corolla that takes a long time to break and accelerate) and I like my passengers to have a smooth ride (meaning no race-car like driving). He also thought about this on the way back and agreed he goes hard on the breaks. I didn't address the issue of acceleration though.</p>
        <h3>5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h3>
          <p>During the drive, I was trying to analyze why I was annoyed with him. I got to some of these conclusions and addressed about half of them. If I could go back, I guess I'd try to analyze it more so I could have addressed each of my issues at the time they occurred. (Reflecting on it now, I think for something small like this it's better to discuss it while it happens then dwell on it and bring it up later when it doesn't. Because then if you don't have a particular example or instance something happened, the person you're telling this to won't have a reference to a time they did such action. Since the "action", aka issue, would be meaningless to them.)</p>
        <h3>6. What did you learn from this experience?</h3>
          <p>It's difficult to analyze why you are feeling the way you are feeling. And to bring this up to the person or persons in question. I learned that I need to analyze quicker and in more depth to be able to resolve the issue more completely and that I shouldn't just get automatically annoyed. It's not good for my mental health or my facial muscles (don't wanna be getting premature wrinkles). Plus, the person(s) in question won't know what's the problem and then further conflict could arise and exacerbate such a small issue and become something even bigger.</p>
