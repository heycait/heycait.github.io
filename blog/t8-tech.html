        <h3>Web Security</h3>
          <p>Web security is a branch of Information Security that deals with the security of websites, web applications, and web services. As people rely more on computers and other devices in their daily lives, the their online presence, interactions, and data must be kept secure from prying eyes. A computer security risk could cause loss of information to software and hardware damages.</p>

        <h3>Types of Web Security Crimes</h3>
          <p>You always hear of hackers and cybercrime but what exactly does that entail? There are different types of computer-related crimes: computer crime and cybercrime. Computer crime is a breach in computer security while a cybercrime is defined as illegal acts based on the Internet. To differentiate, you can think of computer crime as someone sneaking into your home and figuring out your password to access you're computer. A cybercrime on the other hand would be someone accessing your computer remotely through the Internet.</p>

          <p>Most news and governments focus on cybercrimes and those that perpetrate them. Cybercrimes are mostly committed through cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks. XSS is a type of computer security vulnerability found in web applications and enables attackers to add malicious code to the client-side script while SQL injection is exploiting a security vulnerability and adding on code in an application's software through SQL.</p>

        <h3>Kinds of Cyber Criminals</h3>
          <p>In the news, we typically hear about hackers but the perpetrators of cybercrimes are many and varied and can be classified as one of the following kinds: hackers, crackers, cyberterrorists, cyberexrotionists, etc.</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Hacker</strong> - Someone who accesses a computer or computer network unlawfully. They often claim that they do this to find flaws in security. </li>
            <li><strong>Cracker</strong> - Someone who accesses a computer or computer network with malice and intent to destroy or steal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Cyberterrorist</strong> - Someone who uses a computer network or the internet to destroy computer systems for political reasons. </li>
            <li><strong>Cyberextoritionist</strong> - Someone who uses the web for blackmail. These criminals state they will release confidnetial information, exploit a security leak, or launch an attack that will harm a company's network if not agreed to.</li>
          </ol>

        <p>Based on these types of cyber criminals, it would seem we're not using the term "hacker" correctly. Most uses of "hacker" should actually be "cracker". While cyberterrorists are crackers yet crackers are not necessarily cyberterrorists. </p>
