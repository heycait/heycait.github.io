        <h3>Dev Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
          It's the end of the second week of Phase 1 at DBC yet it seems like it's been forever. Let's go back to day 1..
        </p>
        
        <h3>Phase 1, Week 1, Day 1</h3>
        <p>
          The first day was a "meet everyone" day with free breakfast and lunch. It began in the building's lobby and signing in as a visitor until the mentors came down to pass out name tags. Afterwards, they brought us up to meet the other cohorts and everyone else at DBC. Spent a long time bouncing from introductions to advice the other students had for us about how to handle DBC. Once that was over, our phase leader and instructors for our cohort, led us to the Phase 1 area and explained how things work and whatnot (such as storing groceries in the kitchen, gaining access into the building, etc.). 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We finally got to do real "work" around 3:30pm or so. Just like how we were given several coding challenges to complete every week of Phase 0, we had 2 challenges we had to complete that day with a pair. Unfortunately, I hated the first day. (It turns out that in Phase 1 at least, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays are pairing days. Wednesdays are solo days and Fridays are group project days.) The first challenge was okay, I had done it before during phase 0, but I got extremely frustrated that I was not able to complete the second challenge. Although the day is officially over at 6pm, I stayed until 11:30pm and I still couldn't complete it in a way that was not just hard coding everything.

        <h3>My Expectation</h3>
        <p>I thought on-site at DBC would be different. </p>
