  <h2> Fireside Chat: Kitchen VS. Table</h2>
  <h3> My Take On It </h3>
  <h4>02 Feb 15</h4>

  <section>
    <p> <b> Take on DBC </b> </p>
    <p>
      I was kind of surprised to hear the analogy Shereef gave about DBC. I do agree that everyone has that Kitchen vs. Table mindset and I know that I have the Table mindset when it comes to education, especially in regards to teachers. To me, teachers are a critical part of learning a difficult subject. It’s simple to learn algebra or macroeconomics from independent study—I’ve done it before—but something like organic chemistry and programming isn't. However, my expectations aren’t like that for DBC. I understand that it’s more of a learn-by-doing program where the teachers are guides and there to get you started and answer any of the really complex or theory-based questions. The allure of DBC is that there is a community to help you EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. I actually applied to App Academy in addition to DBC because I was hoping for the least amount of risk as possible and from their application process I learned just how critical a community is for learning programming whether it be a formal class setting, a mentor, a pair whatever. I had such a difficult time learning on my own without anyone I could ask the stupid questions. It was when I discovered I couldn’t ask App Academy for help during my “conditional acceptance” and the process to be fully accepted as a student that I realized App Academy wasn’t for me and that I was looking for more than just learning how to code.

    </p>

    <p> <b> Impression of DBC </b> </p>
    <p>
      My impression of DBC is that it’s the original coding bootcamp and that it has grown a lot since it’s first days as an experiment. It has come a long way since then and has developed into a program for raising new developers who have also mastered the social and soft skills necessary to be successful in their futures as devs or whatever else they choose to pursue.
    </p>

    <p> <b> Expectations of DBC </b> </p>
    <p>
      My expectations of DBC haven’t really changed. To begin with, I saw DBC not only as a way for me to begin a career in technology but also as a way for personal growth. I’ve been in a rut every since graduating college and after reading all DBC has to offer, it felt like it was a perfect fit. I somehow went from oozing self-confidence and a belief that I could do or be anything I wanted in high school to doubting myself and my abilities after leaving college. I know that I’m capable yet feel like others can’t see it and I think this has caused me to start hating on myself. That’s why everything that DBC has to offer: yoga, empathy, meditation, feedback, pairing have all resonated with me as a way for my own development. I still see DBC as a path to growth and learning that it’s not perfect is kind of endearing.
    </p>

    <p> <b> Participating in DBC's learning environment </b> </p>

    <p>
      I can’t say how excited I am to participate in this kind of learning environment. As I mentioned above, I’m really bad about taking the initiative when there is no pressure involved (such as a deadline or a school/work assignment) and therefore have had trouble with working towards self-improvement and learning how to program on my own. I’m excited to be doing this with others and can’t wait to actually meet everybody. Although I have to mention that I am a shy person so it may take me awhile to open up. However, all this off-site work has really helped me connect with everybody so by the time I make it out to San Francisco I’m sure it’ll feel like I’ve known everyone forever and won’t need a let-me-see-you-about-50-times-before-I’m-comfortable-with-opening-up-making-friends-and-getting-close-to-you.
    </p>

    <p> <b> Engaging in DBC's culture </b> </p>
      I'll definitely been engaging in the culture as it's the number one reason I chose DBC as my place of programming enlightenment. Not sure exactly in what way I'll be engaging but I'll certainly be bringing my whole self. Nevertheless, I am a little worried about what Shereef said of taking charge of our education. I'm the kind of person that needs some structure and pressure or else I end up not accomplishing anything. As long as it's not solely up to us to actually figure EVERYTHING out, I'll be fine. I've just come to realize I'm horrible at taking the initiative on things I don't really <b>need</b> to do.
    </p>

    <p> <b> Are you nervous? </b> </p>
    <p>
      I am a little nervous about my passion for coding though. I like technology in general as in I like when new technology comes out. I love to play with new phones, tablets, ereaders, etc but I don’t know how much that translates into actual programming. So far what I like about it is that it’s challenging and when I write successful code after many failed attempts, I’m proud of what I accomplished. That’s what I’m looking for in a career. I want a career that will be challenging and give me that feeling of accomplishment and pride when I finally do succeed. I don’t want a mediocre career and that’s one reason why I chose to pursue programming. I mean, who can turn down becoming a developer in 9 weeks and beginning a career (shortly after that) in such a booming field? I just have some worries about my passion for it but perhaps I’ll value those feelings of pride and accomplishments so much that it fuels and becomes my passion for coding.
