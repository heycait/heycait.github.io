        <h3>Exploring My Values</h3>
          <p>
            Prompt: When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?
          </p>

          <p>
            Response: Accomplishment, Achievement, Challenge, Competition, Commitment, Intellectual status, Meaningful work, Merit, Persistence, Responsibility, Recognition
          </p>


        <h3>Why (insert value) Is Important To Me</h3>
          <p>
            Achievement is extremely important to me. Hand-in-hand with this value is also 'challenge'. You can't have achievements without challenges. These values are important to me because they provide meaning to my life. I've realized the last time I was really proud of myself was when I was in high school hoping to achieve my goal of graduating as one of the top 10 students in my magnet school. I've noticed that I haven't been satisfied since then because I haven't been challenged, I haven't had any competition, I haven't put "my all" into doing something.
          </p>

        <h3>Advice</h3>
          <p>
            Prompt: What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important?
          </p>

          <p>
            Response: I struggle to answer these types of questions because when I do talk with people, it's never so clear-cut like, "Can I ask for your advice?" It's always more of a discussion and stating my opinions so I can't really say.
          </p>

        <h3>Values and Stereotype Threat</h3>
          <p>
            Prompt: How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?
          </p>

          <p>
            Response: Thinking about my values now, I feel like I've failed myself. I haven't lived up to these values in so long because I haven't put myself in situations where they would arise. My answer is quite depressing so I'm not sure how that would help me mediate stereotype threat when I feel it. Honestly, the only thing I can do is to do more in order to live up to these values and accomplish things I can be proud of.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prompt: Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?
          </p>

          <p>
            Response: When I am feeling down, I look to friends and family for support and reassurance. Although I get that from them, it sometimes that seems to backfire on me because of impostor syndrome and trying to internally justify what my friends/family think of me and what I can do. It's like a horrible negative feedback loop. The only way I can avoid this is by accruing accomplishments, achievements, merit, and recognition. However, leisurely reading or binge-watching would help take my mind off things too.
