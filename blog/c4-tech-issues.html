        <h3><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/06/what-silicon-valley-thinks-women-302821.html">“We are not getting hired, and we are not getting promoted, and we are being systematically driven out of the industry,” Shanley Kane said in an interview with <i>MIT Technology Review</i> this past Decemeber.</a></h3>

          <p>
            It's sad and crazy to think that not much has changed for women in the 21st century. While there has been progress in some areas and some industries such as on Wall Street due to lawsuits and diversity consultants, it seems Silicon Valley is still in the pre-World Wars era. (ASIDE: I'm not sure exactly how historically accurate it is, but I encourage anyone who likes comics and <i>The Avengers</i> to watch <i>Marvel's Agent Carter</i>. It does an excellent job showing what working women have to face and the sexism that occurs.)
          </p>

          <p>
            RANT: Even if you adamantly deny being feminist, as long as you believe in the idea of justice, equality, and fairness, you also believe that women should be treated as equals, hence you are a feminist. Although that term has incurred a negative connotation, the idea behind it has not. I don't care if you deny the feminist label (that's all it is anyway), I don't care much for the term either, but if you believe you or anyone else you know should be treated fairly, then you cannot ignore how women are being treated in the tech field and every where else.
          </p>

        <h3><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-women-tech-20150222-story.html#page=1">Women Are Leaving the Tech Industry in Droves</a></h3>
          <p>
            I was extremely shocked and worried when I came across this article yesterday. I knew that there weren't many women in the industry but had no idea that, in addition to their low numbers to begin with, they are essentially being driven out! There are several reasons for this whether it be the general case of working women or particularly women in the tech field.
          </p>

          <p>
            1. For all the praise men get for doing the same or voluntary tasks, women get docked if they don't do them. Summarizing the article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/opinion/sunday/sheryl-sandberg-and-adam-grant-on-women-doing-office-housework.html?_r=0"><i>Madam C.E.O., Get Me a Coffee</i></a>, women are expected to do "office housework" whereas men aren't. It's perfectly acceptable, in fact, it's expected for men to refuse to do them. If women refuse, it's a demerit against them while if they agree, they are seen as equivalent to men who refused. Men who accepted are practically seen as gods for going "above and beyond". This needs to change. Women are quickly overtaking men as household breadwinners yet at work they are still seen as the taken for granted "50's wife". How can women be accepted and progress in the career world and tech field if there is so much more expected of us yet nothing to gain from it and everything to lose if we refuse?
          </p>

          <p>
            2. Questions like this <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/110816085436/what-is-the-right-percentage-of-women-in-technical">"What is the right percentage of women in technical careers?"</a> How many women are there in the world? (For those lacking skills in percentages, that'd be 50% of the population). Clearly, the only answer to this is 50%.
          </p>

          <p>
            3. Related to the first point: <a href="http://www.thebroadexperience.com/listen/2013/8/2/episode-24-women-in-tech-speak-up.html">"The truth is that women face a different judgment from the audience than men do, and a lot of women know that..."</a> But do men? We are judged for being women. We are seen as less capable, less tech-savvy, less adventurous/risk-taking, and apparently more time-consuming. We face hostile environments, isolation, and opposition.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is so much to this issue in the tech world, and world at large, that I am not going to regurgitate everything I've come across. The links to the articles provided here will give you more than just the general problem and background listed here but actually cases and experiences of real women. Check them out.
          </p>

        <h3>The Solution?</h3>
          <p>
            1. Expectations, stereotypes, and mindsets about women need to change. This isn't medieval Europe or even the '50s or '60s. It's already 2015. This is a hard thing to do but think about it in terms of the women you know. Do you wish for your mother, sister, friend, girlfriend, etc to be treated with disrespect, cat-called, sexually harassed, slighted, overlooked, taken advantaged of, or the other myriad of things we have to face daily? I'm going to go out on a limb here and answering for you. No. You don't. If you won't treat your [insert: woman, friend, etc] like that, so don't treat a female co-worker like that.
          </p>

          <p>
            2. Training. Along with the previous point, women are different from men. We think differently, we act differently, we do things differently. Just like how men don't understand women when it comes to relationships, they don't tend to understand women in any other aspect either. It's important that companies, business, etc. provide training to both sexes about how to work with each other.
          </p>

          <p>
            3. To all the ladies and myself included: be confident. Show it off. Be proud of who you are, what you are capable of, and what you've accomplished. Don't be afraid to claim credit for your expertise or state your opinions, ideas, or solutions.
          </p>

          <p> And lastly: <br>
            <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-women-tech-20150222-story.html#page=2"><b>"Men need to be the ones that are advocating and pushing for women to rise up, and not just rely on the 1% of women who are already at the top to do it."</b></a>
