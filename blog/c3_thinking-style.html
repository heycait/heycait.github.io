         <h3>Gregorc Thinking Style: Concrete Sequential & Abstract Sequential</h3>

           <p>
             Retaking the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">personal thinking style quiz</a>, I confirmed that I have an equal makeup of <b>concrete sequential</b> and <b>abstract sequential</b> thinking style. What this basically means is that in terms of concrete sequential I like order, logical sequence, direction (predictability), and facts. And in the abstract sequential sphere, I like my views heard and to analyze and apply logic. This also means that I have difficulty working in groups (and with those of differing views), seemingly pointless discussion, incomplete/unclear directions, questions with no right or wrong answer, too many rules and regulations, and too little time to deal with something thoroughly.
           </p>


         <h3>Applying My Thinking Style to DBC</h3>

           <p>
             My thinking style actually seems quite contradictory to DBC's learning environment and culture with all the pair and team programming as well as self-directed learning from doing (aka experimenting). However, I find that some of the qualities <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">listed</a> for my type of thinking doesn't actually or always apply to me personally. For the most part, everything listed about concrete sequential does seem to resonate with my personality, however some aspects of abstract sequential don't. For example, I am not that vocal and I don't tend to monopolize a conversation, therefore I'm not sure how much liking my "point to be heard" applies to me in particular. Although it is true that I like having access to experts/references and tend to like working alone. I don't necessarily hate repeating the same tasks over and over either. But again, most of the qualities do describe me quite well.

           </p>
             As the concrete and abstract sequential thinker that I am, I'm not sure how I can really use this to my advantage at DBC. It seems to me the only parts of my thinking style I could take advantage of at DBC would be utilizing the instructors and guides for information. Other than that, I could use my logical thinking style to solve problems.
           </p>

         <h3>DBC Phase 0: Up to Now</h3>
           <p>
             One of the biggest struggles for me so far has been creating my website. It's a lot of experimenting, which in this case, I'm fine with. However, even all the experimenting I did seems fruitless. The only thing I can do now is try to research and seek help from others. I'm currently reading the <a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/"><cite>HTML & CSS</cite></a> by Jon Duckett to see if I can find answers to my problems and there.
           </p>
           <p>
             Another issue I've been having is pair programming. I find it extremely difficult to work with people on some of these challenges. In my opinion, making a wireframe and a blog template is one of personal style and choice. Thus, working with someone else is really difficult because it's full of compromise. I understand that UX and UI is important, but for a blog, I would think it's really a personal decision and would prefer not to do these specific challenges with others. I think, if it were for a general site, that'd be fine (such as the challenge from GPS1.2)
           </p>
           <p>
             Along with my issues on pair programming for some of the challenges, I find that the idea of pair programming itself is also difficult. It's difficult being the navigator. At least in the website challenges. I find the position of navigator is kind of useless besides checking over what the driver types and inputting suggestions. It's extremely hard for me to just sit there and watch and also incredibly boring. However, I recently did a pairing session on a Ruby challenge and I found that acting as navigator is quite do-able so I'm not sure whether or not I have issues with pair programming itself, or just doing it on specific challenges. It seems to me there's not much I can do about that...

         <h3><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Growth vs. Fixed Mindset</a></h3>
           <p>
             I understand the idea of growth and fixed mindsets and I acknowledge that in parts of my life I have the growth mindset and in others, the fixed mindset. I'm not quite sure what the point of contemplating this idea is although DBC's instructions say to think of some ways to expand the ways you learn and think. I'm not seeing how contemplating <i>the idea</i> of growth or fixed mindset will help <i>expand</i> the way I think however I hope to utilize meditation to exercise my brain. Honestly, this directive just seems to be pointing back to self-awareness, mindfulness, meditation, and productivity from week 1.
