        <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
        <p>
          Pairing is tough. I've only had a handful of pairing sessions that I truly enjoyed while the rest were either extremely frustrating, slightly but still frustrating, or for lack of a better term, just whatever. The sessions I enjoyed were with pairs that were on the same level and had similar thinking styles as me (as in how to go about solving the problem). They were also very respectful about accommodating to my personal habits as well as sought out and were receptive to my ideas. Those sessions were my favorite because I not only learned from my pair in a collaborative environment but also struggled with them but still felt very accomplished at the end. The sessions where I had done the challenges prior and were acting as a guide were alright. I didn't really learn anything although I guess you could say acting as a guide solidified the process I had and why I did it (since I ended up asking questions to help my pair determine what needed to be done and the steps to take). The only thing you could say I learned was how other people think through problems however the challenges I acted as a guide were extremely simple and there was only pretty much one easy way to solve them. The rest of the time, I got frustrated with pairing due to various reasons: perceived disrespect, perceived condescension, difference in skill, difference in thinking, etc.
