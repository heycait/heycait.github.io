        <h3>Asking Good Questions</h3>
        <p>
          Don't let anybody fool you. There ARE such things as dumb questions. To see what makes a good question, check out <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140709094611/http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question.aspx">this site</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          NOTE: While this may seem like a general topic that can be applied to anything, this post is more-so towards the programming community. In programming, there are so many factors that could be relevant and therefore need to be supplied, whereas typical everyday kind of questions don't generally need a lot of background information.
        </p>

        <h3>Analyzing Questions</h3>
        <p> Way back when I was trying to teach myself Ruby and was going through Test First Ruby's problem set, I asked this question on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25342586/testfirst-learn-ruby-simon-says">Stackoverflow</a>:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Question:</strong> TestFirst Learn Ruby Simon Says
          <br> <strong>Post:</strong> I'm doing TestFirst.org's Learn Ruby tutorial and am currently on exercise number 3 Simon Says. I'm not sure if this is a problem or if it's interfering with my tests (and giving me the wrong results) using rspec, but the terminal prints out some error messages before it shows that all my tests have passed. <code>[sample code]</code> It gives a warning for the simon_says_spec.rb but this is the spec provided by the TestFirst Learn Ruby tutorial. Why is there a problem with this? Also, is it a big issue that it says 'All examples were filtered out; ignoring {:focus=>true|}'?
        </p>

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>The first problem with this question is the title question. That is not a question nor is it descriptive enough of the issue contained within it. Instead I could have written something like, "Why does rspec message say it filtered out examples yet passes all examples at the end of Test First Ruby's Simon Says problem?"</li>
            <li>The second, there are too many "question" like sentences within the post itself. The part "I'm not sure if this is a problem or if it's interfering with my tests (and giving me the wrong results) using rspec.." really isn't necessary and takes away from the overall questions. Instead, I should have left this bit out.</li>
            <li>While I did receive the answers to the two questions I asked at the end, I did not get a resolution of the problem. At the time I had no clue what I was really doing and the answer that I was using a newer version of RSpec didn't tell me exactly how to get/install/use the older version so that I would not get this issue. And while the same person did answer my second question and provided a link for the explanation, as a complete programming newbie I had no clue what all that meant and wasn't given a completely-novice-friendly explanation. Therefore, this question is not a good question in that it fails to provide enough information to potential repliers that would indicate I needed a stupidly-simple and jargon free answer. Next time, I should indicate my level of familiarity with this or request specifically a novice-centric response and read of the question I actually ask to make sure I include a question that would get me an answer that resolves the issue.</li>
