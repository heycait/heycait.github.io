      These reflections sure are getting repetitive. But I guess that’s good as now the answers just come spewing out. The one downside though is it also makes me question myself. The questions are pretty much restated in different ways but sometimes it makes me feel like I’m still missing something, like in the last challenge where it asked “How does tracking and adding changes make a developer’s lives easier?”. Is this just basically asking about version control and it’s uses and benefits or is there some thing else I’m not seeing here that “makes a dev’s life easier"?

        Anyways, it’s time to get serious and answer these questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        1. What are the benefits of version control?
    </p>
    <p>

        2. How does git help you keep track of changes?
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Why use GitHub to store you code?
    </p>

    <p>
      The benefits of version control is that you can view every change made to a file/project. It’s a history or a log of everything that’s happened from the start to the present. This is important because it allows you to check the progress and see how the project evolved as well as go back to an old version if the present one has too many problems, was accidentally deleted, or runs into some other setback. It also provides information as to who did what and when which allows you to reference that person and their work later on if needed.

    <p>
      There are many different types of version control systems and Git is one of them. Git is the system that does all the tracking and storing of the different versions. It also provides other features at the same time. For example, when working on a part of a file that you want to edit, you don’t have to do that right on the file itself but in a copy of it. The benefit of this is that you don’t have to mess with the original file until you know for sure what you’ve been working on is functional. Once you know your additions are viable, you can add your changes back into the original. This function of editing a copy and adding it back to the original is known as branching and merging.

      While Git is a version control system, it is only a local system meaning it only tracks and stores information on the computer it’s on. GitHub, on the other hand, is an online hub that stores Gits from individuals, hence the name GitHub. It acts as a connection for individuals to store their Gits (or their log of changes), access others’ files and make changes, and basically is a central tool for collaborating on a project. In a way, it’s like your Git cloud that anyone anywhere can access if you give them that privilege and it’ll track and store all changes in real-time.
